Aim: This experiment illustrates the use of hierarchical clustering with Weka explorer. 
The sample data set used for this example is based on the student data available in ARFF format.
This document assumes that appropriate preprocessing has been performed.
This istudent dataset includes 14 instances.

Procedure:-
load dataset
go to cluster tab -> choose -> hierarchical clustering
